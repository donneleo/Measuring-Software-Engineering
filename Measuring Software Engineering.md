## Assignment 3 – Measuring Software Engineering

“From a more abstract point of view, the goal of software measurement is to build and validate hypotheses and increase the body of knowledge about software engineering” (Morasca, n.d.). There isn’t a company in the world who do not evaluate the performance and production of their workers. The use of metrics can allow for management to clearly see how effective a worker has been over a period of time. In some cases, this may be the number of units produced or the number of tables served. However, measuring software engineering is complex also in that there may not be a uniform standard for what needs to be measured. The use of normal metric such as these are not applicable to the world of software engineering, where projects can vary between taking place over a number of weeks or months to create large scale applications, to taking place over a single day in order to fix small bugs and errors.

In this paper, we will explore some of the new technologies and methodologies which are being used to measure software engineering, the platforms being used to measure and the ethical aspects of using some of these technologies.

## Methods of yesteryear

Counting the number of lines of code is a method that has been employed for many years but carries with it many flaws. “Source Lines of Code (SLOC or LOC) is one of the most widely used sizing metric in industry and literature” (Nguyen, et.al, 2007). However, there is often confusion regarding what constitutes a “source line of code”.  Measuring engineers on the number of lines od code they write can lead to serious issues of inefficiency. For example:

    if(num%2 == 0)
    {
      print(“Number is Even.”)
    }

is correct and is equivalent to four physical SLOC. However, this simple statement can be simplified down to one physical SLOC:

    if(num%2 ==0) print(“Number is Even.”);

While the two functions perform the same task, the physical number of lines makes the first piece of code less efficient. By measuring software engineers on the number of SLOC in their systems, it promotes the use of inefficient, unnecessarily long code, which, when applied to systems of a massive size, can lead to complications when trying to debug.  Another issue with counting SLOC, especially in the present day with new languages, such as Python, which can perform operations in fewer lines of code, is that programmers will be swayed away from using these more efficient languages. The following piece of code reverses a string in Java,taken from GeeksForGeeks.com, containg nineteen physical SLOC.

    // Java program to ReverseString using ByteArray.
    import java.lang.*;
    import java.io.*;
    import java.util.*;
 
    // Class of ReverseString
    class ReverseString {
        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
            String input = "GeeksForGeeks";
 
            // getBytes() method to convert string
            // into bytes[].
            byte[] strAsByteArray = input.getBytes();
 
            byte[] result = new byte[strAsByteArray.length];
 
            // Store result in reverse order into the
            // result byte[]
            for (int i = 0; i < strAsByteArray.length; i++)
            result[i] = strAsByteArray[strAsByteArray.length - i - 1];
 
            System.out.println(new String(result));
        }
    }
    
Meanwhile the same function can be carried in Python Programming Language in a much more efficient way, using only two pyhsical SLOC:

    txt = "GeeksforGeeks"[::-1]
    print(txt)

There are of course tools that exist that aid in the counting of these SLOC. In 2004, there were “at least 75 commercial software cost-estimating tools” (Jones, 2004). Again, however, these tools count the lines, and not the *importance* of the lines written for the programmes. Think for example, of writing the code for accepting payment on an e-commerce site. The code written for this function will most likely be less than that the of the whole site. So, by having the tool say that a particular engineer has written a proportionally small X% of code for the whole store, the code written is an integral piece to the system. 

Another method which has been used before to measure the work of a software engineer is the number of commits they have to their repository of work. While this, again, can be a reflection of how often the engineer works, or how consistently they commit code into a project, this again is a flawed method of measurement. Any minute change to a piece of code needs to be committed to the repository in order to become a part of the project. So, while an engineer may be committing on a consistent basis, many commits may only be for small spelling errors, rather than meaningful contributions to a project.

Some believe that the irrelevance of measuring metrics is due in large part to how little relevance they have based on industry needs. The irrelevance here is due to two main factors:

**•	Irrelevance of Scope** – Many of the metrics used to measure software “can only ever be applied/computed for small programs, whereas all the reasonable objectives for applying metrics are relevant primarily for large systems” (Fenton & Martin, 2007)

**•	Irrelevance of Content** – The metrics that academics are using to measure software engineering are very often not in line with the metrics used within the industry and are therefore redundant.

In recent years, many products have been created to monitor the work, efficiency and general well-being of software engineers. These tools come with a myriad of benefits and faults. 

## Devices in Use

Timeular is an example of new technologies being used to measure to the of software engineers. A small, eight-sided dice that sits on the engineers desk, the Timeular device can be set face-down on a particular side which begins a clock, timing how long an engineer has been working on a particular aspect of their job. There are options for answering emails, coding and even taking coffee breaks. Such a device, in theory should prove wonders, as employers or line managers can track exactly for how long their employees have been working and assess them with the aid of this information. However, the device is not without fault. Which brings us to our ethical dilemma. The use of this device can only be successful in a setting where the employee can be trusted to *actually* carry out the task they claim to be working on, rather than setting the device to say they are coding, only to spend the next thirty minutes or so browsing videos on YouTube.
